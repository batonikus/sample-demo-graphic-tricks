Small example of 'oldschool' demo tricks like:

3D tunnel,
3D pipes,
floating text,
3D bouncing ball

Demo can be run (using Java Web Start) using http://baton.pop.e-wro.pl/sample-demo-graphic-tricks/client.jnlp url.
To run it you must first add an 'security exception' for that URL (application is self-signed). To do it you need to:
- Startmenu >> Java >> Configure Java >> Security >> Edit site list
- add/paste the http://baton.pop.e-wro.pl/sample-demo-graphic-tricks/client.jnlp there and add it as exception
- now you can run it by clicking above JNLP url or by typing into your shell/command window:
    javaws http://baton.pop.e-wro.pl/sample-demo-graphic-tricks/client.jnlp
